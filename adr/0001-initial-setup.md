# ADR 0001: Initial Organizational Setup

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We chose GitHub as the hosting platform and created the organization `segolab`.  
The first repository `segolab/segolab` self-documents the structure and principles.

## Decision
- Use GitHub as the primary platform.
- Use a repo named the same as the organization for self-documentation.

## Consequences
- Future repositories must document decisions in the `adr/` folder or use ADR templates.
- This repo acts as a mirror of the evolving structure and mission.
